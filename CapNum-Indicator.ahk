/* CapNum-Indicator
	
	This program displays a notifier indicating that either the capslock or numlock
	is toggle on/off on the bottom right corner of the screen allowing an ease of
	access for users without a LED light indicator on their keyboards.

	Thank you for trying out this small program and I hope this suits your needs. 
	If there are any issues with this program, feel free to let me know on Github.
