# CapNum-Indicator

## **Reason:**
Personal Project

## **Description:** 
On my laptop, I do not have the LED light indicator that usually comes with the caps/num lock keys which sometimes confuses me on whether either of them are on/off. This simple program solves this issue by checking the state of the caps/num lock keys and lets the user know if they are toggled on via simple ui notification. 

## **Notes:** 
I have decided to change over to Auto Hot Key due to my current limited knowledge of GUI and my belief that this program will be not as complex as I imagined it to be. I first started this program off in Python but realized that this project would be very small and Auto Hot Key allows their .ahk files to be turned into .exe files for easy execution.

I have also decided to change the tooltips to show only when the caps/num lock is on and have those tooltips stay on the screen until they are off instead of having the tooltips show if either are on/off and then dissappear a second after. I realize that my previous approach to this would still leave users confused on if their caps/num lock is on.
