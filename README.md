# CapNum-Indicator

## **Reason:**
Personal Project

## **Note:** 
I have decided to change over to Auto Hot Key due to my current limited knowledge of GUI and my belief that this program will be not as complex as I imagined it to be.

## **Description:** 
A simple Auto Hot Key program that checks if the caps lock or num lock key has been pressed and lets the user know if they are toggled on or off via simple ui notification. This is mainly used if you don't have the led indicator that are on these keys.
