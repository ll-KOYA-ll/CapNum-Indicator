# CapNum-Checker

## **Reason:**
Personal Project

## **Description:** 
A simple Java GUI program that checks if the caps lock or num lock key has been pressed and lets the user know if they are toggled on or off via simple ui notification. This is mainly used if you don't have the light notifier feature that's usually on these two keys. Both the num lock and caps lock notifiers can be turned on or off depending on your use case. This program will automatically run when your computer turns on.
