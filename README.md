# CapNum-Indicator

## **Reason:**
Personal Project

## **Description:** 
A simple Auto Hot Key program that checks if the caps lock or num lock key has been pressed and lets the user know if they are toggled on or off via simple ui notification. This is mainly used if you don't have the led indicator that are on these keys.

## **Notes:** 
I have decided to change over to Auto Hot Key due to my current limited knowledge of GUI and my belief that this program will be not as complex as I imagined it to be.

I have also decided to change the tooltips to show only when the caps/num lock is on and have those tooltips stay on the screen until they are off instead of having the tooltips show if either are on/off and then dissappear a second after. I realize that my previous approach to this would still leave users confused on if their caps/num lock is on.
